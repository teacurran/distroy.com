## archive of code for distroy.com

This is the site and e-commerce software for distroy.com
 
This code ran the site from 2003 to 2010 when we stopped taking orders on the site.

It was written to work with MS SQL server. After several years I got tired of paying for SQL server hosting
but I wanted to keep the site live for posterity. The post github changes to the code are to make the site 
run on MySQL.

Portions of the e-commerce transition to MySQL have not been thoroughly tested since that is currently 
disabled on the site.
