<b>Card Verification Number</b>
<br>
Your card verification number, often referred to as a CVV2 code is a unique three or four digit number found on your credit card that provides extra security to help protect you against fraud.

            <b>Visa, MasterCard & Discover</b><br />
            The CVV2 code is 3 digits printed on Visa, MasterCard, and Discover cards in the signature panel on the back of the card.  It is the last 3 digits AFTER the credit card number. Sometimes only the last 4 digits of your credit card number will be printed before the CVV2 code instead of the entire credit card number.
